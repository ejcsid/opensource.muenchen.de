# Open Source Sabbatical

> Following the creation and establishment of an Open Source Programme Office (Open Source Hubs), a Munich Open Source Sabbatical will be introduced.
[^application]

> The open source sabbatical is intended to provide professionally qualified software developers with the opportunity to work on an open source project for a limited period of time.
The programme is not only aimed at LHM employees, but also explicitly at external software developers.
In order to enable external software developers to take such a sabbatical, LHM should provide financial compensation for the loss of earnings.

[Resolution 20-26 / V 08681](https://risi.muenchen.de/risi/sitzungsvorlage/detail/7532900)


## Application

> Professionally qualified programmers apply to work on open source projects for a certain period of time.
> ...
> The sabbatical is open to international applications. In order to connect the participants, they can work together with the employees of the Open Source Programme Office. The call for applications should indicate that there is a particular interest in applications from women.
[^application]

We are open in the selection of open source sabbaticals and look forward to ideas from external and internal developers.
These can be bug fixes, features for projects from the [own development portfolio](https://github.com/it-at-m) of the City of Munich.
But they can also be completely different free projects if there is a benefit for the city of Munich.

Applications can be submitted informally to [opensource@muenchen.de](mailto:opensource@muenchen.de), stating the software project and the start date.


## Financial compensation

> The sabbatical is compensated in an attractive amount, so that the programmers can take time off work from their employer. The participants are not bound by instructions.
[^application]

We can currently offer financial compensation:

### External software developers

A __permanent permanent position__ is generally possible with a six-month material reason.

A fixed-term permanent position is possible via the digital consulting company of the City of Munich [digital@M](https://digital-at-m.de/).
Our target for financial compensation is 60% of the usual salary.

A __work contract__ or __service contract__ is difficult to realise due to the pre-award consultation, the preparation of the award and contract documents and a call for tenders for the contract by the awarding authority


### Employees of the LHM

__Temporary assignments__ within LHM offer employees development opportunities and can be realised at short notice.
The prerequisite is the consent of the department making the assignment.
The open source sabbatical is also possible as an internship during vocational training or the dual study programme, provided the project fits in with the training plan.  
A __direct appointment__ within the LHM is possible, provided that the necessary position has been created and there is a possibility of compensation at the departing department.
