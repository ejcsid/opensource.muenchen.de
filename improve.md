# Improve

Not all free software can be [used](./use.html) immediately and without restrictions, especially when it comes to security and feature requirements.
This is where the advantage of free software lies:
It allows people to improve the software and actively participate in fixing bugs and implementing new features.
In this way, free software can be continuously developed and adapted to the needs of users.

## Code Contributions

Besides the [self-publications](./publish.html) of LHM, we also contribute to other FOSS projects through __Contributions__.
Contributions can take different forms and do not always have to include new features or bug fixes.
Also the correction or update of documentation can be a valuable contribution.

All contributions are created and contributed using our [github account as fork repositories](https://github.com/orgs/it-at-m/repositories?type=fork).

## Funding

Even though open source software is free, development and maintenance must be paid for.
Different [business models for open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_models_for_open-source_software) enable secure and stable software and sponsor further development.  
As different as the developers of open source software are, the models for financing must also be different.

### Sponsoring

We financially support free software that we use frequently.
In this way, we can help to ensure that the development and maintenance of free software remains guaranteed and that the software continues to meet our needs.

### Support

Free software is best understood by those who write it.
Vendors provide highly qualified support and can directly influence development.
Commercial support is thus one of the most important ways to fund and promote free software.
The City of Munich is happy to use this opportunity to get help and support quickly and to build internal expertise.

However, it is important to note that open source software is professionally supported and subject to an orderly lifecycle.
This is essential to ensure timely security updates and to minimize the risk of support gaps if, for example, a community project is temporarily orphaned.
Therefore, the City typically contracts with service providers who can deliver this support.

### Open Core

The open-core model is a business model for financing commercially produced open-source software.
It primarily involves offering a "core" or functionally limited version of a software product as free and open source software, while offering "commercial" versions or add-ons as proprietary software.

As the city of Munich, we use this model to test software faster and promote the FOSS ecosystem.
By being independent from a single vendor, we avoid financial dependencies and can run the software independently.
