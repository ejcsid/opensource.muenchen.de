## Reference Architecture for in-house development {#refarch}

The guideline "City of Munich Reference Architecture for Self-Developed Software" defines the technical structure of self-developed software.
To ensure optimal maintainability and scalability of the software, we rely on a modular technology stack of open source components.
This allows us to easily exchange and update components.
Open source plays a dual role in the reference architecture for in-house developments:
On the one hand, as explained above, we rely on a 100% open source stack.
On the other hand, however, the City of Munich will publish all in-house developments on the basis of an open source license.
