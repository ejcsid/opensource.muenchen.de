# Contribution

Not all free software can be [used](./use.html) immediately and with all security and feature requirements.
Free software also allows you to __improve__ it and help fix bugs or add features.

## Code Contributions

In addition to the large [own publications](./publish.html) of us, employees of the LHM have also contributed to FOSS projects with __Contributions__.
Contributions do not always have to be new features or bugfixes, but can also be e.g. corrections or updates of documentation.

All are created and contributed with our [github account as fork repositories](https://github.com/orgs/it-at-m/repositories?type=fork).

## Sponsoring

Free software is best understood by those who write it.
But of course [we improve free software](./contribute.html) or [publish ourselves](./publish.html) free software.
But sometimes money helps out more than 1000 commits - that's why we financially support software that we use frequently.
