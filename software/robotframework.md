__Robot Framework__ is a generic framework for performing automated software testing with a focus on acceptance testing.
Robot uses a simple table-like structure to manage test data and relies on keyword-driven testing.

Also important for us is the possibility for integrations into our system landscape through open interfaces.
Robot Framework is integrated into the equally free [Checkmk](checkmk), and allows us e.g. to process browser tests from _Robot Framework_ directly in Checkmk.
