__Robot Framework__ is a generic framework for performing automated software testing with a focus on acceptance testing.
Robot uses a simple table-like structure to manage test data and relies on keyword-driven testing.

The possibilities for integration into our system landscape through open interfaces are important for LHM.
Robot Framework is used for various tasks:

* with a plugin, Robot Framework is integrated into [Checkmk](checkmk), which is also free, and enables, for example, browser tests to be called up directly in Checkmk and the test results to be displayed in Checkmk.
* as a test framework in the geodata portal.
* as an automatic tool for Windows client installation as well as for regression tests after BIOS updates.
