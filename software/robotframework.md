__Robot Framework__ is a generic automation framework that can be used for both test automation and robotic process automation.

---

The possibilities for integration into our system landscape through open interfaces are important for LHM.
Robot Framework is used for various tasks:

* with a plugin, Robot Framework is integrated into [Checkmk](checkmk), which is also free, and enables, for example, browser tests to be called up directly in Checkmk and the test results to be displayed in Checkmk.
* as a test framework in the [Digital Twin](https://muenchen.digital/projekte/digitaler-zwilling.html).
* as an automatic tool for Windows client installation as well as for regression tests after BIOS updates.
