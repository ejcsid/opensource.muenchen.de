__Integreat__ is a local and multilingual integration platform for immigrants that can be used in any municipality without the involvement of the IT department.

---

LHM has been using integreat as a SAAS service since March 2022.
On the Integreat Munich platform, people from Ukraine receive multilingual initial information to support and welcome them when they arrive in Munich - both via the free and offline Integreat app (download via Google Play Store or App Store) and at [integreat.app/muenchen/](https://integreat.app/muenchen/).
