__OpenAPI Generator__ enables the automatic generation of API client libraries (SDK generation), server stubs, documentation and configuration based on an OpenAPI specification.
The OpenAPI specification is a standard for describing HTTP programming interfaces (APIs), which can also be used to define REST-compliant interfaces.

LHM offers numerous IT services and we link these services with each other using open interfaces.
The OpenAPI specification enables us to define standardized interfaces ourselves, but also with manufacturers.
Using the OpenAPI Generator, we can easily generate client and server components based on these definitions.

Numerous proprietary, internal but also [open source applications use the OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Ait-at-m+openapi-generator&type=code).
