__OpenStreetMap__ is a free project that collects and structures freely usable geodata, maintains it as open data and provides online maps.

The City of Munich uses OpenStreetMap as a map source for the [Geoportal](geoportal.html) outside of Munich, as we do not have any official maps available there.
But other applications such as the [Kitafinder](https://kitafinder.muenchen.de/elternportal/de/einrichtungen/karte/ergebnisse) or the free [mark-a-spot](mark-a-spot.html) ([maengelmelder.muenchen.de](https://maengelmelder.muenchen.de)) also use OpenStreetMap.

Munich is also interested in making OpenStreetMap better.

The LHM provides official aerial photographs with a high-quality resolution of 20 cm for the creation of maps [available](https://github.com/osmlab/editor-layer-index/blob/gh-pages/sources/europe/de/AktuelleLuftbilderDerLandeshauptstadtMuenchen20cm.geojson?short_path=cdc4d8a) to OpenStreetMap for map creation.
