__OpenStreetMap__ is a free project that collects and structures freely usable geodata, maintains it as open data and provides online maps.

The City of Munich uses OpenStreetMap as a map source for areas outside the city limits in its [Geoportal](geoportal.html).
But other free applications such as [Kitafinder](https://kitafinder.muenchen.de/elternportal/de/einrichtungen/karte/ergebnisse) and [mark-a-spot](mark-a-spot.html) (in the form of [maengelmelder.muenchen.de](https://maengelmelder.muenchen.de)) also use OpenStreetMap.

Munich is also interested in making OpenStreetMap better.

The LHM provides official aerial photographs with a high-quality resolution of 20 cm for the creation of maps [available](https://github.com/osmlab/editor-layer-index/blob/gh-pages/sources/europe/de/AktuelleLuftbilderDerLandeshauptstadtMuenchen20cm.geojson?short_path=cdc4d8a) to OpenStreetMap for map creation.
