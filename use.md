# Use

> We use free software wherever possible!

The Free Software ecosystem offers numerous solutions and applications.
Modern software development is no longer possible without free software.
Almost all software products contain free software.


## Infrastructure

In addition to the workplace platform for employees of the City of Munich, which is the subject of intense public attention in the debate on the use of open source solutions,
the City of Munich also operates an extensive portfolio of software in its own data center.
It consists of the approximately 350 central specialist applications and central services hosted in the data center, as well as everything that is required for their operation and the services they require,
as well as everything required for their operation and the underlying infrastructure.

In this environment, open source is used everywhere in accordance with the IT architecture classification,
where, in a market comparison, open source solutions are available as established standard solutions, and where
where a high degree of customization is required in the interests of the City of Munich.

## E- and Open Government

Open source software is also used in the area of e- and open government:

## Support

Free software is best understood by those who write it.
Vendor companies offer highly qualified support and can directly influence the development.
Commercial support is one of the most important ways to fund free software.

We like to use it to get help and support quickly and also to build internal competence.
But also to promote free software that way.

It should be noted that in all the areas where open source software is used, the City of Munich attaches great importance to the fact
that the software is professionally supported and subject to an orderly lifecycle. Among other things, this is absolutely necessary to ensure timely security updates.
As a rule, contracts are therefore concluded with service providers who supply this support.
This approach is common in the IT industry to avoid the risk of sudden gaps in support if, for example, a community project is temporarily orphaned.

## Open-Core

The open core model is a business model for financing commercially produced open source software.
The open core model, primarily involves offering a "core" or feature-limited version of a software product as free and open source software,
while "commercial" versions or add-ons are offered as proprietary software.

As the city of Munich, this gives us the opportunity to test software more quickly and thus promotes the FOSS ecosystem.
Since we do not necessarily need the manufacturer to run the software, we also avoid financial dependencies.

## Overview

Overall, of course, we use much more free software.
